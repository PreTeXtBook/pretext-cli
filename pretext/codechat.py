# codechat.py -- Compute mapping used by the CodeChat System
# ***********************************************************
# This function computes a mapping between source file names and the resulting HTML files built from them by PreTeXt. The `CodeChat System <https://codechat-system.readthedocs.io>`_ then uses this mapping to synchronize between a source file and its resulting rendered form.
#
#
# Imports
# =======
# These are listed in the order prescribed by `PEP 8
# <http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#imports>`_.
#
# Standard library
# ----------------
import collections  # defaultdict
import glob  # glob
import json  # dumps
from pathlib import Path
import sys  # platform
import urllib.parse  # urlparse
import urllib.request  # pathname2url

# Third-party imports
# -------------------
# We assume a previous call to ``xsltproc`` has already verified that lxml is installed.
import lxml.etree as ET
import lxml.ElementInclude

# Local application imports
# -------------------------
# None.


# Mapping
# =======
# Build a mapping between XML IDs and the resulting generated HTML files. The goal: map from source files to the resulting HTML files produced by the pretext build. The data structure is:
#
# .. code::
#   :number-lines:
#
#   path_to_xml_id: Dict[
#       # A path to the source file
#       str,
#       # A list of XML IDs in this source file which produce HTML files.
#       List[str]
#   ]
#
# This allows a single source file to produce multiple HTML files, as well as supporting a one-to-one relationship. The list captures the order of appearance of the XML IDs in the tree -- element 0 is the first XML ID, etc.
def map_path_to_xml_id(
    # A path to the root XML file in the pretext book being processed.
    xml: Path,
    # A path to the project directory, which (should) contain ``codechat_config.yaml``.
    project_path: Path,
    # A path to the destination or output directory. The resulting JSON file will be stored there.
    dest_dir: str,
) -> None:
    # Make insertions easy by specifying that newly-created entries in ``path_to_xml_id`` contain an empty list.
    path_to_xml_id = collections.defaultdict(list)

    # Normalize path separators to current OS.
    _xml = str(xml.resolve())

    # This follows the `Python recommendations <https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.platform>`_.
    is_win = sys.platform == "win32"

    # Look at all HTML files in the output directory. Store only their stem, since this is what an XML ID specifies. Note that all output files will have the same path prefix (the ``dest_dir`` and the same suffix (``.html``); the stem is the only unique part.
