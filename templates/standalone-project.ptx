<!--
This standalone project manifest will be used to build documents that are not part of a project with their own project.ptx file.
This allows a user to build a pretext file outside of a project and get sensible defaults for output in the standard formats where this is reasonable.
All targets are standalone, so the output will be placed adjacent to the source file.  For html, this will be in a folder so as to not pollute the source directory.
