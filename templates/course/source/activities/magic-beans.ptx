            <title>Magic Beans</title>
            <introduction>
                <p>
                    You have traded your cow for 5 magic chocolate covered espresso beans.
                    Each night at midnight, each bean splits into three beans.
                    To take advantage of this, you eat 8 beans each morning for breakfast.
                    You wonder how many beans you will have <em>after</em> breakfast 30 days after you traded your cow.
                </p>
        
                <p>
                    Let <m>(b_n)_{n\ge 0}</m> be the sequence of number of beans you have <m>n</m> days after trading your cow, (after breakfast, before midnight; take <m>b_0 = 5</m>).
                </p>

                            Then give a recursive definition for the sequence and explain how you know it is correct.
